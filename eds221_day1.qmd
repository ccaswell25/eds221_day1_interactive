## Working Directories

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

### Read in Data 

\>\>Use read_csv() to read in data

\>\>Tell it to read the complete path in the parentheses

```{r}
energy <- read_csv("data/us_energy.csv")
```

\>\>Create a line chart of energy over time, with color based on the energy type

```{r}
ggplot(data = energy, aes(x = year, y = quadrillion_btu)) + geom_line(aes(color = type))
                                                                      
```

\>\> We can also write the code above by re-writing it to input the data and variables directly in the graph type :

```{r}
ggplot() +
geom_point(data = energy, aes(x = year, y = quadrillion_btu, group = type, color = type))
```
